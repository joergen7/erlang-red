%%
%% The MQTT manager is used by the mqtt in and mqtt out nodes as a shield
%% from unexpected behaviour. Such as a MQTT broker not being there when
%% wanting to connect.
%%
%% The emqtt library assumes the owner is also a gen_server of some kind
%% and will propagate a shutdown all the way up the linked ladder.
%%
%% So this gen_server is started as an unlinked gen_server so that the
%% emqtt gen_server can link itself to this manager. If the emqtt
%% does transmit a shutdown exit message, it stops here and doesn't
%% teardown either the node process nor the rest of the servers.
%%
%% In addition, what this does is map the messages sent from the emqtt
%% library to ErlangRED messages, e.g publish becomes mqtt_incoming and
%% is converted to a cast, instead of info.
%%
%% TODO there should really only be one of these for a collection of MQTT
%% TODO nodes. In fact, there should be one per config node. This would
%% TODO require more work so LIFL - leave it for later!

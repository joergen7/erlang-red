This is tcp-out node set to **reply** mode meaning it needs a `_session` attribute on the message to know where to send messages it receives to.\n\n## Test\n\nThe <a class=\"ahl-node-only\" data-ids=\"b19e4f202ce8e9f9\">inject node</a> sends a \"hello world\" message to the <a class=\"ahl-node-only\" data-ids=\"efcdb65d343c28d5\">tcp out</a> node without a `_session` attribute on the message.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf the <a class=\"ahl-node-only\" data-ids=\"dd0e889f20803d72\">tcp:localhost:1234</a> node is set to \"single string\" instead if \"stream of strings\", then it receives nothing.\n\nSo it receives a message from the tcp-out node, sends it to the listener and the response with a \"ok\" and that is sent back to it.\n\n**NOTE**: the difference between single string and stream of strings is that the string is only sent once the [connection is dropped](https://github.com/node-red/node-red/blob/01815b995e1bf2c87a82afe1a51d563a2d83fe31/packages/node_modules/%40node-red/nodes/core/network/31-tcpin.js#L158-L168).","env":[{"name":"ERED_PENDING","value":"true","type":"bool"}]},{"id":"cdf9310b209c1838","type":"tcp in","z":"cfa8595b2e2b8269","name":"","server":"server","host":"","port":"1202","datamode":"stream","datatype":"utf8","newline":"","topic":"","trim":false,"base64":false,"tls":"","x":609,"y":444,"wires":[["1a2c994da573bbdf","922894e195cfced3"]]},{"id":"1a2c994da573bbdf","type":"ut-assert-values","z":"cfa8595b2e2b8269","name":"","ignore_failure_if_succeed":false,"rules":[{"t":"eql","p":"payload","pt":"msg","to":"hello world","tot":"str"}],"x":1040,"y":444,"wires":[[]]},{"id":"efcdb65d343c28d5","type":"tcp out","z":"cfa8595b2e2b8269","name":"","host":"","port":"","beserver":"reply","base64":false,"end":false,"tls":"","x":1000,"y":318.5,"wires":[]},{"id":"b19e4f202ce8e9f9","type":"inject","z":"cfa8595b2e2b8269","name":"","props":[{"p":"payload"}],"repeat":"","crontab":"","once":false,"onceDelay":0.1,"topic":"","payload":"hello world","payloadType":"str","x":609,"y":318.5,"wires":[["efcdb65d343c28d5"]]},{"id":"922894e195cfced3","type":"change","z":"cfa8595b2e2b8269","name":"set payload to 'ok'","rules":[{"t":"set","p":"payload","pt":"msg","to":"ok","tot":"str"}],"action":"","property":"","from":"","to":"","reg":false,"x":809,"y":379.5,"wires":[["efcdb65d343c28d5"]]},{"id":"dd0e889f20803d72","type":"tcp in","z":"cfa8595b2e2b8269","name":"","server":"client","host":"localhost","port":"1202","datamode":"stream","datatype":"utf8","newline":"","topic":"","trim":false,"base64":false,"tls":"","x":579,"y":558.25,"wires":[["b39f939d9714e413","e8a72df7e2694bc4"]]},{"id":"b39f939d9714e413","type":"ut-assert-values","z":"cfa8595b2e2b8269","name":"","ignore_failure_if_succeed":true,"rules":[{"t":"eql","p":"payload","pt":"msg","to":"hello world","tot":"str"}],"x":1040,"y":558.25,"wires":[[]]},{"id":"e8a72df7e2694bc4","type":"ut-assert-values","z":"cfa8595b2e2b8269","name":"","ignore_failure_if_succeed":true,"rules":[{"t":"eql","p":"payload","pt":"msg","to":"ok","tot":"str"}],"x":980,"y":637,"wires":[[]]}]
